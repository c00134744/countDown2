# Product Context

## Why this project exists
To provide a simple, aesthetic, and distraction-free countdown timer specifically designed for short durations (up to 45 minutes). It aims to replace complex or generic timer apps with a specialized tool that offers a unique "satellite orbit" visual metaphor.

## Problems it solves
- **Generic Timers:** Most timers are utilitarian and lack visual appeal.
- **Complexity:** Eliminates the need to type numbers; uses intuitive gestures (dragging).
- **Focus:** 45-minute limit aligns with common focus sessions (Pomodoro-like) or short tasks.
- **Background Reliability:** Ensures the timer continues and notifies even when the app is backgrounded.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Control:** Setting time by dragging a "satellite" button along a circular track.
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear green/gray track indicating elapsed/remaining time.
- **Immersive Design:** Dark mode with Glassmorphism effects for a modern, sleek look.
- **Uninterruptible:** Foreground service ensures the timer is robust against system kills.
- **Low Friction:** Quick start, pause, and reset actions.

## Key Features
1.  **Circular Interface:** 45-minute max orbit.
2.  **Gesture Input:** Drag the satellite button to set time.
3.  **Visual Progress:** Satellite moves clockwise; track changes color.
4.  **Background Support:** Foreground service with notifications.
5.  **Notifications:** Sound and vibration alerts upon completion.
6.  **Screen Management:** Keeps screen on during countdown (configurable).
